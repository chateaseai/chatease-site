# ChatEase – v3.4

Fixes & polish:
- Logo now has a built-in fallback (PNG → SVG) so it always renders
- Navigation restyled: subtle pills + active underline (less visual noise)
- Deeper modern-cool background so the page doesn't feel white/flat
- Layout hardening to avoid any left-shift; containers centered consistently
