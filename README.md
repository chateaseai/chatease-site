# ChatEase â€“ v3.1 (React + Vite + Tailwind, Netlify-ready)

- Fixed `Logo.jsx` JSX comments & balance (build error resolved)
- Added `vite.config.js` with externals + shims for Node-only modules
- Same visuals as v3 (colorful sections, hero, how-it-works, CTA)

Deploy:
- Build: `npm install && npm run build`
- Publish dir: `dist`
